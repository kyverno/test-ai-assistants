# Architecture

kyverno-assistant is a [Hermes profile distribution](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profile-distributions):
`distribution.yaml` + `SOUL.md` + `config.yaml` + `skills/` + `plugins/` + `hooks/` +
`cron/`, git-installed with `hermes profile install`, updated with `hermes profile update`.

- A single, on-demand agent process talking to one maintainer over Slack/CLI — not a
  webhook-triggered service. Human-invoked only, by design (see `SOUL.md`); triggered or
  autonomous operation is out of scope, not an oversight.
- MCP servers (GitHub, Slack) are declared under `config.yaml`'s `mcp_servers:` key directly
  — no separate `mcp.json`. A standalone `mcp.json` is only an *import* format
  (`hermes import-agent claude-code`), not something a profile install reads.
- `docs/archive/` holds an earlier, abandoned webhook-triggered design (`kyctrl`) — reference
  only, not part of this project.

## What it can and can't do

- Reads anything on `KYVERNO_REPO`: PRs, diffs, reviews, labels, CODEOWNERS, milestones,
  issues, Discussions, security/Dependabot alerts, Actions logs. Reads the configured Slack
  channel.
- Using the maintainer's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`: adds labels, posts comments, requests changes,
  approves reviews, updates a PR branch against its base, replies to Discussions.
- **Cannot merge a PR.** No merge tool exists anywhere in the toolset — enforced in three
  independent layers (below), not a prompt instruction. See `docs/workflow.md`'s "What the
  agent cannot do" for the full, current action boundary list.
- Cannot re-trigger or detect post-merge CI on its own — no webhook receiver, no polling.
  If the maintainer mentions CI broke on `main`, `pr-queue` can take that as input and check
  file overlap against the current queue, but this is conversational, not monitored.

## Toolset allowlist — three independent layers

1. **`mcp_servers.github.env.GITHUB_EXCLUDE_TOOLS`** — the `github-mcp-server` container's
   own `--exclude-tools` flag; disables tools regardless of any other setting.
   `GITHUB_TOOLSETS: "all"` is set deliberately, not a named toolset group — the default
   toolset omits tools this profile needs (`list_code_scanning_alerts`,
   `list_dependabot_alerts`, `actions_list`, `list_label`, `list_discussions`, ...), so the
   exclude list is the real narrowing mechanism, not the toolset name.
2. **`mcp_servers.github.tools.include`** — Hermes' own per-tool filter, matched against raw
   (unprefixed) tool names.
3. **`hooks.pre_tool_call` → `hooks/block-dangerous-tools.sh`** — a shell hook, `matcher`-
   scoped to `merge|delete_repo|force_push`, `fail_closed: true` (shell hooks fail open by
   default; this is inverted on purpose for a security gate). Reads the tool-call event as
   JSON from stdin — Hermes pipes the event that way, not via an env var. Every invocation
   that matches the `matcher` is blocked; there's no conditional branch inside the hook.

`hooks/block-mnemosyne-triples.sh` is the same pattern, scoped to `mnemosyne_triple_add`,
restricting it to the exact 5 predicates this distribution writes (`memory.write_approval`
stages `mnemosyne_remember` correctly but doesn't gate `triple_add`, which commits straight to
the database — this hook is the real control for that one tool).

Slack is narrower by design — only `conversations_history`/`conversations_add_message` are
ever wanted:
- `SLACK_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` must list both tools explicitly, even though only one writes —
  tool *registration* and the per-call channel restriction are independent checks in the
  server; omitting a tool from this list means it never registers at all, regardless of the
  channel scoping.
- `SLACK_MCP_ADD_MESSAGE_TOOL=${SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL}` is the actual write-channel restriction,
  enforced at call time, independent of the list above.
- The server fetches all four Slack channel types (`public_channel`/`private_channel`/`mpim`/
  `im`) in one call at boot and exits fatally if the token is missing a scope for any one of
  them — so the bot token needs `channels:read`/`groups:read`/`mpim:read`/`im:read` even
  though this profile only reads one public channel.
- `conversations_history` takes a time/count `limit`, no search query — "did anyone mention
  this PR in Slack" is a bounded-window scan with client-side text matching, never a real
  search (Slack's own `search.messages` API doesn't work with a bot token anyway).

## Why two bundled plugins instead of MCP servers

`plugins/kyverno-fetch/` and `plugins/kyverno-sequencer/` are bundled Hermes plugins (plain
Python, not MCP servers) — `__init__.py` exposes `register(ctx)`, which registers each
tool's schema (from `tools.py`) with Hermes; still needs an explicit `config.yaml` toolset
grant and a `plugins.enabled:` entry like any other tool — bundled isn't auto-trusted. They
ship with the repo (no separate packaging step, no extra install) and are discovered
per-profile under `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/plugins/<name>/`.

- **`kyverno-fetch`** — `fetch_pr_candidates(repo, search_query, limit)` replaces what would
  otherwise be a `search_pull_requests` call plus one sequential `pull_request_read` per PR
  (real cost against a live queue: dozens of PRs, one round trip each). It talks to GitHub's
  GraphQL/REST APIs directly over `urllib` using the profile's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` — same
  scopes already granted to the `github` MCP server, no new credential — and does its search
  pass plus a concurrent (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, max 8) per-PR detail pass inside one tool
  call. Returns per PR: labels, milestone, `author_association`, size, CI state (the PR's own
  checks, with the "E2E Gate" status excluded — see below), CodeRabbit approval,
  `closing_issues` (each with its own milestone/labels/open-state), and `external_references`
  (a body reference like "Depends on #N" resolved to its real kind/state/title, since issues
  and PRs share one GitHub number sequence). `fetch_file_diff_overlap(repo, path, pr_numbers)`
  fetches each PR's real diff for one file on demand — raw patches only, no computed
  conflict verdict (two PRs' hunk line numbers are relative to different merge-bases with
  `main`, so comparing them numerically isn't reliable; the agent reads the content itself).
- **`kyverno-sequencer`** — `sequence_prs` takes that richer metadata and builds a hard
  dependency graph, no scoring: 4 edge types (stacked branches — one PR's base branch is
  another's head; generated-file input-before-output; an explicit body reference to another
  candidate; two candidates closing the same issue, which goes to `unresolved` instead of an
  edge), cycle detection (Kahn's algorithm), and topological layering into **tiers** by
  repeated Kahn's-algorithm peeling. Within a tier, no hard edge exists between any member —
  the tool returns them flat and unordered; ordering within a tier is the agent's judgment
  call (session context, Slack/Discussions, maintainer history), made explicit in
  `skills/pr-queue/SKILL.md`'s precedence ladder, not something the tool decides. Also
  computes per-PR annotations: file classification (`GENERATED` > `API_SURFACE` >
  `ADMISSION_CRITICAL` > `TEST_ONLY` > `STANDARD`), `rebase_flag` (shares a changed file with
  an earlier tier), `file_overlaps`/`package_overlaps` (no hard edge), `gate_blocked`
  (branch-level e2e-gate status, independent of `ready-for-review`).

## Why codegen and CI structure matter for sequencing

From `kyverno/kyverno`'s own `Makefile` and `.github/workflows/`:

- Anything under `api/**` fans out to generated code (`zz_generated.register.go`,
  `zz_generated.deepcopy.go`, clientset/lister/informer, CRDs). Two PRs that both touch
  `api/**` conflict on the *generated* files even if their own diffs don't overlap.
- The expensive test suite (conformance, policy-library, k6, perf) only runs on `push` to
  `main`/`release-*`, never on `pull_request` — a bad interaction between two merged PRs
  lands on `main` undetected. `e2e-gate.yaml` turns that into a reactive block: once that
  suite fails, a required "E2E Gate" status goes red on every open PR targeting the broken
  branch until the tracking issue closes or the PR carries `e2e-gate-bypass`.
- A red "E2E Gate" check does **not** block `ready-for-review` — that label only gates on
  DCO/CI/conflicts/unresolved-threads. `gate_blocked` and `ready-for-review` are independent
  signals; a PR can carry both, and `pr-queue` states them separately rather than conflating
  them.

See `skills/kyverno-context/SKILL.md` for the full codegen/CI reference and
`skills/pr-queue/SKILL.md` for how it's used in sequencing.

## Why labels and CODEOWNERS are never hardcoded

`KYVERNO_REPO` can point at `kyverno/kyverno` or a sandbox repo, each with its own label set
and CODEOWNERS file. `kyverno-context` resolves both live every session (`list_label`,
`get_file_contents` on `CODEOWNERS`) rather than assuming it already knows a repo's
conventions — the same principle extends to `AGENTS.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` (cached into
Mnemosyne by `scripts/install.sh`, recalled instead of re-fetched) and to arbitrary repo
questions (`search_code`, scoped with `repo:${KYVERNO_REPO}` explicitly — it is not
auto-scoped).

`search_code` approximates "what would this break" via text search — no real call graph, so
it misses interface-based indirection in Go. A `gopls`-backed MCP server for real
call-graph edges is a tracked future item, not built — see `docs/workflow.md`'s build plan.

## Maintainer questions are open-ended — skills aren't scripts

A maintainer can ask anything about the queue's or an issue's state, not just a fixed set of
actions. `pr-queue`/`pr-actions`/`issue-triage`/`issue-actions` are written as tools + fixed
facts + one generalizing instinct — when something about the repo's state is unknown, look
it up and cite it, never guess — rather than a fixed procedure per anticipated question.

## Two independent Slack integrations, same bot token

- **Hermes' `platforms.slack` adapter** — how the maintainer talks to the agent (mentions,
  DMs). Uses `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` over Socket Mode via Hermes' built-in Bolt
  integration.
- **The `slack` MCP server** (`korotovsky/slack-mcp-server`) — a *tool* the agent calls to
  read `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL`'s history and post into it. Talks to Slack's Web API directly;
  no concept of Socket Mode or an app-level token. Given `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (as
  `SLACK_MCP_XOXB_TOKEN`), never `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.

If Slack replies work but the queue never posts (or vice versa), these are two independent
code paths — check which one is actually failing before assuming a single token problem.

Hermes runs exactly one gateway *per host*, not per profile, as the inbound process for every
profile's messaging platforms — `kyverno chat` only starts a foreground CLI session; it never
makes anything listen for a Slack mention. The gateway is installed once from the `default`
profile (`hermes gateway install`), serving every profile including `kyverno`; a per-profile
`hermes gateway run`/`install` fails on purpose once a host gateway exists, to guard against
double-binding one bot token from two pollers. `scripts/install.sh` installs it automatically
when Slack credentials are present.

## What's not built yet

`docs/workflow.md` is the target spec and its own "Build plan" section is the current,
phased plan for the gap between that spec and what's described above — issue work, the
dashboard, session open/close, and the remaining PR decide-table rows. Read it there, not
duplicated here.
